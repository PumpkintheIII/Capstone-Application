        <h2>Fire Building Info-board Demonstration</h2>
        <p>This is a demonstration of what this could look like. While this is not close to what I think a final product would look like, it is hopefully helpful to see what it could look like.</p>
        <p>This Home page would contain basic information such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What the project is.</li>
          <li>Why it is important.</li>
          <li>How to use it.</li>

        <h2>How to use this</h2>
        <p>Here is a brief explanation of this application:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On your left you have a list of pages of information. By pressing each of them, you can navigate around the application to learn different aspects of fire building. While I have currently only included a few basic topics, there is much more to fire building that could be added in the future.</li>
          <li>On the top of the page, you have a header that tells the user what page they are on. This gives the user a general idea of what they will learn in this part of the application.</li>
          <li>Below the header, there is a scrollable list of cards that contain the information the application intends to teach.</li>
          <li>At the bottom of the page is a button to move onto the next page. This allows a user to move onto the next part of the application without using the navigation bar.</li>
        </ul>
